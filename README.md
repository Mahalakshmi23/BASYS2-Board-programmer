# BASYS2-Board-programmer
Design a circuit on the BASYS 2 board that displays a binary number entered using the slider switches.Slider switch 3 corresponds to the most significant bit and slider switch 0 the least
significant bit. When a momentary push button is pressed the number represented on the slider
switches should be latched and displayed on the corresponding digit on the seven-segment
display. It should remain displayed until a new number is latched for that specific digit (by
pressing momentary push button again). You may assume that no more than one momentary
push button will be pressed at a time. The number latched should be displayed as a hexadecimal
digit (0 through F). The LEDs (3 through 0) should reflect the value on the slider switches.
When a switch is moved to a different position, the LEDs should immediately reflect the change.
